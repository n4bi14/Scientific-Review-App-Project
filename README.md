# Capstone Project - Scientific Review Application 
## Overview

Our goal this semester was to come up with an application that would help speed up the process of finding relevant articles. This would be done through retrieving the full text of articles from Pubmed  according to a given userâ€™s search, ranking the retrieved articles by how relevant they are and then creating a summary of the 100 most relevant articles using Gemini that would then be output to the user.

## Quick Note
1. **Important!** To have a functioning program, you'll need to add a Gemini AI API-key to the program. Once you have your key, you'll find the proper spot for it in SummaryGeneration.py.
